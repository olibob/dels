## Elasticsearch + Kibana + sense plugin

Quick docker setup to get [elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/) (stable 2 version) and [kibana](https://hub.docker.com/_/kibana/) with the [sense plugin](https://github.com/elastic/sense) up and running.

This has been tested on Docker for Mac  1.12.0-rc2.

Both kibana and elasticsearch run on the standard ports.

Access kibana at http://localhost:5601 and sense on http://localhost:5601/app/sense
